All .nc files are from Angshuman, and are for the fixed-SST experiments Control(1xCO2), 0.5xCO2, 2xCO2, piClim-histall. Hege renamed temp2 to tas.


Notes from Angshuman:

This are global annual mean files for 50 years fixed-SST simulations for
Control(1xCO2), 0.5xCO2, 2xCO2

For following variables-
temp2(2m temperature), rsdt, rsut, rlut.
I have also given the 'tsland', in case you want to correct for the land surface warming.
